# Py_Metric_Sense

## Project Overview

Py_Metric_Sense is a Python tool that automates the comparison of monthly Excel data, specifically, highlighting the differences between various months. It takes as input two Excel files (representing data from two different months) and provides an output that shows the differences between the two.

## Dependencies

- Python
- Pandas
- openpyxl

## Usage

To use the tool, follow these steps:

1. Place the Excel files you wish to compare in the `/data` directory.
2. Run the main script from the project's root directory:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

The script will generate an Excel file containing the comparison results.

## Next steps

1. Fix comparison logic.
2. Add more data filters.
3. Add error handling for all python files.
4. Add a command line interface/parser.
5. Add more data comparison options.
6. Dockerize/package the project.
7. Create a Tableau script to visualize the data.
8. Add a machine learning model to analyze where differences came from.
9. Connect to Tableau to visualize the data.
10. Add support for more than two files.
11. Add support for more data types.
12. Add a database.
13. Add a GUI.
14. Add unit tests.
